**Front End Projects - DigitalCrafts**
 
 **Anthony, Kevin, and Nathan**



The parameters of the project are:

**1.)** Implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices with at least three breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop.

**2.)** Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)

**3.)** Use fewer than 3 global variables (numerous constants are fine, but should be limited to primitive values like numbers and strings)

Our Boredom Killer webpgae is designed strictly for killing time. 
You have many features to entertain you such as trivia, inspirational quotes, and a stickman full of jokes.
